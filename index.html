					</ul>
					

					<h3 class="pink-heading">17 - 23 Jan '22</h3>
					<p>Spent Sunday eve/Monday morning creating a simple landing page using a Bootstrap template from mdbootstrap.com - template was a bit basic, but I think the finished result looks OK. Have hosted it on Github: <a href="https://catehardy.github.io/vegan-revolution/" target="_blank">https://catehardy.github.io/vegan-revolution/</a>. (Topic choice was because I've been looking at lots of vegan sites, to help Ben with various things!)</p>
					<p>Things I did:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Swapped out content (images, text, favicon) for ones I created</li>
						<li>Chose a colour-scheme</li>
						<li>Chose a new font for the heading</li>
						<li>CSS: got rid of box-shadows, modified existing classes to alter button and link colours, hover colours, font styles and sizes, and &lt;hr&gt; styling</li>
						<li>Made a MailChimp sign-up form for a freebie</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Question I have:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How do people modify minified css files, when they're using templates?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Other actions this week:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Changed GitHub username to catehardy and learned how to add/remove a remote repo via Bash.</li>
						<li>Learned a bit about Scrum, Kanban and agile development methods.</li>
						<li>Created new <a href="https://twitter.com/CoderCate" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@catehardy" target="_blank">Medium.com</a> accounts for chatting about coding and web development, networking and learning.</li>
						<li>Added a sidebar to this site (using CSS grid) and removed the top-navigation (will add something for mobile devices soon)</li>
						<li>Completed ZTM sections 9 and 10 - CSS Grid and CSS Layout; Career of a Developer. The CSS Grid and Layout section was trickier than I expected, once I got to the exercise where we were asked to create a webpage layout (lesson 97). I found a working solution for the header, cover and footer but gave up on figuring out the portfolio grid and went to the solution video in the end, as I was just getting lost in googling things and getting frustrated. I was happy to see that I'd got some things right, but I feel that I need to study the correct structure and go from there. I'd gotten in a mess by turning the whole page into a grid and then trying to create another grid inside it, not realising that in this case only the portfolio section needed to be a grid. I also wasn't sure if I should be using flexbox for that section and spent hours fiddling about trying to do that at first. It felt like my whole brain was made up of disconnected divs at one point!! I'd also done some other quirky things and created a weird horizontal overflow. I like this course, but the emphasis on whisking quickly through the HTML and CSS to get onto the JS (as this is the bit employers will be interested in) is going against my usual approach of learning things thoroughly and I'm struggling with some imposter syndrome about finding CSS layouts quite difficult. Very glad I already know a tiny bit about Git/GitHub and have programmed a little bit in C, so the upcoming sections don't feel completely unfamiliar!</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="pink-heading">10 - 16 Jan '22</h3>
					<p>Actions this week:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Completed the following sections of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course:
							<ul>
								<li>Applied Visual Design</li>
								<li>Applied Accessibility</li>
								<li>Responsive Web Design Principles</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Completed ZTM Bootstrap section (apart from landing page, which I'll finish Monday morn)</li>
						<li>Helped Ben add some additional CSS to his site</li>
						<li>Passed the LinkedIn CSS skills test, to get profile badge</li>
						<li>Made improvements to this site: added table of contents to CSS page, organised code for all pages (fixed indentations and removed unused CSS classes)</li>
						<li>Put this site online via GitHub Pages
							<ul>
								<li>Things I've learned:<br>1) GitHub Pages is case-sensitive for filenames.<br>2) The GP servers can take a few mins to update and show changes.<br>3) I need to create an auth code regularly to access GitHub from my CLI (passwords are deprecated).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Have invented new low-tech method of fixing problems with code or tools: lie down on floor in starfish position and stare angrily at ceiling until brain stops spinning. Something useful tends to pop up once I give my brain the chance to file things properly. I'm calling it starfish defragging, in style of rubber duck debugging.</p>
					
					<h3 class="pink-heading">30 Dec 21 - 09 Jan '22</h3>
					<p>This first entry is actually a week-and-a-half, due to starting over the New Year holiday.<br><br>So far I've:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Completed sections 1-7 (Intro, HTML, and CSS)</li>
						<li>Practised some CSS using the games recommended (love Flexbox Froggy and CSS Diner!)</li>
						<li>Built this site - so far it's got a page for each main course section and this diary, a flexbox Portfolio page (currently blank) and a working top nav bar (with some help from W3Schools info). Topnav is NOT responsive yet and looks like total arse on mobile devices... but I'm just working through the course and will get to that soon (I hope! If not, will look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> - although it has some JS and I haven't got to that just yet! Trying not to jump ahead of myself, but it's hard not to want to DO things &#128579;)</li>
