				<h2>Progress Diary</h2>
				<p>Updates every Sunday eve about what I've done this week. Using it for motivation and reminders on things to do/look up.</p>
				<h3 class="darkHeading"><mark>30/12/21 - 09/01/22</mark></h3>
				<p>This first entry is actually a week-and-a-half, due to starting over the New Year holiday.<br><br>So far I've:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Completed sections 1-7 (Intro, HTML, and CSS)</li>
					<li>Practised some CSS using the games recommended (love Flexbox Froggy and CSS Diner!)</li>
					<li>Built this site - so far it's got a page for each main course section and this diary, a flexbox Portfolio page (currently blank) and a working top nav bar (with some help from W3Schools info). Topnav is NOT responsive yet and looks like total arse on mobile devices... but I'm just working through the course and will get to that soon (I hope! If not, will look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> - although it has some JS and I haven't got to that just yet! Trying not to jump ahead of myself, but it's hard not to want to DO things &#128579;)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="darkHeading"><mark>10/01/22 - 16/01/22</mark></h3>
				<p>Actions this week:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Completed the following sections of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course:
						<ul>
							<li>Applied Visual Design</li>
							<li>Applied Accessibility</li>
							<li>Responsive Web Design Principles</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Completed ZTM Bootstrap section (apart from landing page, which I'll finish Monday morn)</li>
					<li>Helped Ben add some additional CSS to his site</li>
					<li>Passed the LinkedIn CSS skills test, to get profile badge</li>
					<li>Made improvements to this site: added table of contents to CSS page, organised code for all pages (fixed indentations and removed unused CSS classes)</li>
					<li>Put this site online via GitHub Pages
						<ul>
							<li>Things I've learned:<br>1) GitHub Pages is case-sensitive for filenames.<br>2) The GP servers can take a few mins to update and show changes.<br>3) I need to create an auth code regularly to access GitHub from my CLI (passwords are deprecated).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Have invented new low-tech method of fixing problems with code or tools: lie down on floor in starfish position and stare angrily at ceiling until brain stops spinning. Something useful tends to pop up once I give my brain the chance to file things properly. I'm calling it starfish defragging, in style of rubber duck debugging.</p>
				<h3 class="darkHeading"><mark>17/01/22 - 23/01/22</mark></h3>
				<p>( Plans: ZTM sections 9 and 10 - CSS Grid and CSS Layout; Career of a Developer.<br>FreeCodeCamp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#css-flexbox" target="_blank">CSS Flexbox</a> and CSS Grid.<br>Update site using Grid/Flexbox skills and Bootstrap components.<br>Keep updating using Git and GitHub. )</p>
				<p>Spent Sunday eve/Monday morning creating a simple landing page using a Bootstrap template from mdbootstrap.com - template was a bit basic, but I think the finished result looks OK. Have hosted it on Github: <a href="https://catehardy.github.io/vegan-revolution/" target="_blank">https://bonbonsai.github.io/vegan-revolution/</a>. (Topic choice was because I've been looking at lots of vegan sites, to help Ben with various things!)</p>
				<p>Things I did:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Swapped out content (images, text, favicon) for ones I created</li>
					<li>Chose a colour-scheme</li>
					<li>Chose a new font for the heading</li>
					<li>CSS: got rid of dated box-shadows, modified existing classes to alter button and link colours, hover colours, font styles and sizes, and &lt;hr&gt; styling</li>
					<li>Made a MailChimp sign-up form for a freebie</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Things I learned:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Altering minified css files is way too hard, so I had to override property values using the dreaded '!important'. I don't think this was proper use of that rule (more of a sledgehammer approach) so I'll need to learn how people normally modify templates.</li>
					<li>Pre-made templates feel pretty limited - or at least the free ones I've seen so far. I think making my own templates using Bootstrap would be fun, though!</li>
				</ul>
